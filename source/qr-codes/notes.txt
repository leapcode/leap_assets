I used http://goqr.me/ to generate the svg files. They don't have a white border
which means that the won't work unless displayed against a white background.

The urls used here are:

* https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.leap.bitmaskclient
  this one will work for both android clients and non-android clients
  although there is not much point to support non-android
  
* market://details?id=se.leap.bitmaskclient
  will open directly in google play app
  
* https://dl.bitmask.net/client/android/Bitmask-Android-latest.apk
  for directly downloading the apk
